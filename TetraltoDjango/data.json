Great presentation of options and materials, prompt replies to post-estimate questions. Best price on the new roof. Thorough communication. He was on-site for most of the 2-day process. Excellent follow-up. When I struggled just getting so-called top-rated roofing companies to show for an estimate, I really appreciated David's service, concise selling (no BS), no gimmicks like call these satisfied customers for $100 off. His crew was great and respectful too. Had a roofing friend check the roof a couple weeks after and he said it was all first-class work and materials.",

The crew started working early in the morning and finished by the evening.  Dave was in and out to make sure the work followed exactly the process that was laid out (which was spelled out in the contract).   Finally,  the crew thoroughly cleaned up the debris and even advised that if any debris had blown over to the neighbors, they would come back and clean up.   Overall, the job was efficient, thorough, and very professional. Compared to many roofers who tried to sell me their services, Tetralto Roofing absolutely stands out in terms of cost & quality.   I would highly recommend them to anyone who's looking for a professional well managed roofing company!",

Prior to selecting a contractor, I got at least 5 or 6 bids.  Of these, the selection came down to two I felt comfortable with as contractors who could be trusted.  A competitive price is always a factor when selecting a contractor, but material quality, workmanship, and supervision must also be considered.

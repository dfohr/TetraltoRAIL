Development Standards for TetraltoRail Project

1. Code Quality:
   - Keep code simple and readable
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - No "clever" hacks or overly complex solutions
   - Document any non-obvious code decisions

2. Dev/Prod Parity:
   - Minimize differences between development and production environments
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Keep dependencies consistent between environments
   - Document any necessary environment-specific settings

3. Security:
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Follow Django security best practices
   - Regular security updates for dependencies

4. Testing:
   - Write tests for critical functionality
   - Test in conditions similar to production

5. Documentation:
   - Clear README with setup instructions
   - Document environment variables
   - Document deployment process

6. Problem-Solving Approach:
   - Consider fundamental principles before specific fixes
   - Prefer solutions that automatically adapt to content
   - Think through implications for:
     * Different screen sizes and devices
     * Dynamic or changing content
     * Future maintenance needs
     * Accessibility requirements
   - Evaluate and explain trade-offs between approaches
   - If using fixed values (heights, padding, etc.), justify why they're necessary
   - Question whether a solution addresses root causes or just symptoms
   - Consider edge cases and potential future requirements

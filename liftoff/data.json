The crew started working early in the morning and finished by the evening.  Dave was in and out to make sure the work followed exactly the process that was laid out (which was spelled out in the contract).   Finally,  the crew thoroughly cleaned up the debris and even advised that if any debris had blown over to the neighbors, they would come back and clean up.

We had the pleasure of working with fantastic homeowners on this project, and the results were truly outstanding.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"/static/images/blog-braeburn-1.avif\" /></p>\n<p>For this job, we installed <strong>Malarkey Vista¬Æ AR</strong> shingles in the sleek <strong>Storm Grey</strong> color. These high-performance shingles are not only visually appealing but also offer superior protection against algae growth, keeping the roof looking fresh and clean over time. The Storm Grey color beautifully complemented the home‚Äôs exterior, giving it a modern, refined look that truly enhanced its curb appeal.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"/static/images/blog-braeburn-2.avif\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to the roofing, we also installed new gutters to ensure the home has a reliable drainage system. This combination of a durable roof and efficient gutters creates a long-lasting solution to protect the home from weather-related issues. The end result? As the homeowners put it, their home received ‚Äúa facelift,‚Äù and we couldn‚Äôt agree more!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"/static/images/blog-braeburn-3.avif\" /></p>\n<p>The Braeburn community is known for its charming homes, and this project added even more character to the neighborhood. Working with such kind and enthusiastic homeowners made the process even more enjoyable, and we‚Äôre thrilled with how the project turned out.</p>\n<p>At Tetralto Roofing, we‚Äôre committed to delivering not only top-quality roofing systems but also an exceptional customer experience. Whether you need a full roof replacement, gutter installation, or both, we‚Äôre here to make your home look and perform at its best.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"alt\" src=\"/static/images/blog-braeburn-4.avif\" /></p>",

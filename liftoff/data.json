The crew started working early in the morning and finished by the evening.  Dave was in and out to make sure the work followed exactly the process that was laid out (which was spelled out in the contract).   Finally,  the crew thoroughly cleaned up the debris and even advised that if any debris had blown over to the neighbors, they would come back and clean up.

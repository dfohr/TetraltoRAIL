# TetraltoRail Deployment Chronicle

This document tracks our deployment process, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented for the TetraltoRail project.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: TetraltoRail
- **Main Application**: TetraltoDjango
- **Deployment Platform**: Railway.app
- **Repository**: [TetraltoRAIL on GitHub](https://github.com/dfohr/TetraltoRAIL)

## Deployment History

### April 2025 - Initial Deployment

## Deployment Challenges and Solutions

### April 2025 - Railway CLI Upload Size Limitations

**Issue**: 
When attempting to deploy using `railway up`, we encountered timeout errors. Investigation revealed our project size is approximately 117MB, which exceeds Railway's 45MB upload limit for direct deployments.

**Project Size Analysis**:
- Total project size: 117MB
- Static files: 57MB (primarily large blog images)
- Staticfiles directory: 59MB (duplicates of static files generated by collectstatic)

**Solution**:
Switching to GitHub-based deployments to:
1. Only deploy changed files, bypassing the 45MB limit
2. Improve deployment reliability
3. Maintain better version control and rollback capabilities

**Next Steps**:
1. Connect the GitHub repository to Railway
2. Configure proper deployment settings in Railway dashboard
3. Consider moving large static assets to a CDN in the future
4. Optimize image files to reduce overall project size

### April 2025 - SSH Access and Name Collision Issues

**Issue**:
We encountered difficulties establishing SSH access to our Railway deployment. Initial attempts to connect via SSH failed, and we suspected configuration issues with the service.

**Investigation**:
After multiple troubleshooting attempts, we identified that a name collision between our service configurations was causing the problem. The build process was getting confused by conflicting configuration files or service names.

**Solution**:
1. Removed problematic pre-deploy commands from our configuration
2. Simplified the deployment configuration to avoid name collisions
3. Switched from Railpack to Nixpacks as the builder, which provided a more standardized build process
4. Ensured consistent naming across all configuration files and environment variables

**Result**:
Successfully established SSH access to the deployed application, which provides:
1. Direct troubleshooting capabilities in the production environment
2. Ability to examine logs and file structures in real-time
3. Option to perform emergency fixes when needed
4. Better visibility into how our application is running in production

**Lessons Learned**:
Consistent naming and simplified configuration are crucial for Railway deployments. When multiple configuration approaches overlap (like mixing Railpack and Nixpacks configurations), Railway may experience conflicts that prevent proper service execution and SSH access.

### April 7, 2025 - GitHub Integration for Deployment

**Plan**:
After determining that the Railway CLI upload method is not feasible due to our project size exceeding the 45MB limit, we're now preparing to connect TetraltoDjango to Railway via GitHub integration.

**Current Status**:
1. Created a checkpoint commit (13df4f7) that contains:
   - Our deployment chronicle documentation
   - Updated data export in data.json
   - New blog images for the algae streaks content
2. All changes pushed to the GitHub repository

**Next Steps**:
1. Connect our GitHub repository to Railway
2. Configure the deployment settings in Railway dashboard
3. Set up environment variables
4. Test the deployment process
5. Monitor the first GitHub-triggered deployment

**Rollback Information**:
If we encounter issues with this new deployment approach, we can revert to our current state using:
```bash
git reset --hard 13df4f7
```

This ensures we have a stable point to return to if the GitHub integration doesn't work as expected.

**Update - April 7, 2025**:
Successfully connected the GitHub repository to Railway with the following configuration:
1. Repository: dfohr/TetraltoRAIL
2. Root Directory: TetraltoDjango
3. Branch: main

The deployment worked perfectly on the first attempt. Specifying `TetraltoDjango` as the root directory was essential since our Django application is contained within this subdirectory rather than at the repository root. This approach allows us to maintain documentation and other files outside the application directory while still enabling smooth Railway deployment.

Benefits observed:
- Eliminated the timeout errors encountered with railway up
- Deployment process is faster and more reliable
- Changes automatically deploy when pushed to GitHub
- No need to manually run collectstatic or other commands

## Future Considerations for Microservices Architecture

As we plan to transition to a microservices architecture:

1. GitHub-based deployments will allow independent deployment of each service
2. Only changed services will be rebuilt and deployed
3. Individual services can have their own CI/CD workflows
4. Storage solutions for static assets will need to be implemented across services

## Deployment Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Purpose | Set In |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| RAILPACK_DJANGO_APP_NAME | Specifies the WSGI application | Railway Dashboard |
| RAILPACK_DJANGO_WORKDIR | Sets the working directory | Railway Dashboard |
| DATABASE_URL | Connection string for PostgreSQL | Railway Dashboard |
| DJANGO_SECRET_KEY | Secret key for Django | Railway Dashboard |
| DJANGO_DEBUG | Enable/disable debug mode | Railway Dashboard |

## Deployment Commands and Processes

**GitHub-based Deployment**:
1. Push changes to the GitHub repository
2. Railway automatically detects changes and rebuilds the service
3. Deployment logs can be viewed in the Railway dashboard

**Manual Deployment (for reference)**:
```bash
# This no longer works due to size limitations
railway up
```

**SSH Access**:
```bash
# Connect to the deployed service
railway ssh
```
